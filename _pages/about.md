Hi! I'm a dedicated software engineer researcher with a focus on the intersection of ethics and software development. My interest lies in exploring how technology impacts users and uncovering the ethical concerns they face. I'm currently investigating mobile applications to understand the ethical challenges and how they can be addressed in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Through my research, I aim to promote a more user-centric approach to technology.

I am currently a MSc student at the Universiy of Calgary, supervised by <a href="https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/gouri-ginde-deshpande" target="blank">Dr. Gouri Ginde</a>.
