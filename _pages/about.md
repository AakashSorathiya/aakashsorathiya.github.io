As a master's student in Software Engineering at the University of Calgary and a former Specialist Programmer at Infosys, I present a compelling combination of practical industry experience and advanced research skills. 

My three years of tenure at Infosys have provided me with comprehensive experience in developing enterprise-level applications. I spearheaded a team of engineers to standardize secure data exchange between Sabre and Aeromexico, which played a pivotal role in their cloud transformation and contributed to a 29% revenue boost. My efforts in integrating Phoenix Database with Adobe Experience Platform helped attract two major clients, potentially generating $500K in revenue. I have consistently showcased my capability to optimize system performance, implement robust CI/CD pipelines, and guide cross-functional teams in delivering high-quality software solutions. Additionally, I have engaged in numerous projects that have refined my problem-solving skills and fostered effective collaboration with diverse teams. 

Currently, as a Graduate Researcher at the University of Calgary, I am engaged in research at the intersection of applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) and software engineering, focusing on leveraging advanced NLP techniques to improve user experience by addressing ethical concerns associated with mobile application usage. This academic endeavor has further enhanced my analytical abilities and reinforced my dedication to developing user-centric software solutions. 

My technical expertise includes: 
- Domain: Backend development, Applied ML, Applied NLP 
- Programming Languages: Java, Python, C++ 
- Framework: SpringBoot, Spring, PyTorch, Django, FastAPI 
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Git 
- Database Technologies: Neo4j, PostgreSQL, SQL 
- Testing: JUnit, Mockito 

I am especially eager to become part of a dynamic team where I can leverage my extensive experience in software development and research to contribute to pioneering solutions. My expertise in both enterprise software development and ethical AI research equips me with a distinctive perspective in tackling technical challenges with the needs of users.
