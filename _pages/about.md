Hi! I am an MSc student at the intersection of ethics and software development in the Software Engineering program at <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="blank">University of Calgary</a>, where I'm supervised by <a href="https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/gouri-ginde-deshpande" target="blank">Dr. Gouri Ginde</a>. My research explores the impact of AI on users and uncovers the ethical concerns they face using machine learning techniques. I'm currently investigating mobile applications to understand the ethical challenges and how the same can be addressed in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Through my research, I aim to promote a more user-centric approach to technology.

Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.infosys.com/" target="blank">Infosys</a> as a Software Engineer for 3 years.
